![Herb Susmann](/public/images/me.png){:class="pull-right"}

I grew up near Ithaca, New York, where I was home-schooled for elementary school, an experience that shaped my belief in the value of self-directed, intrinsically motivated learning. I went to college at [SUNY Geneseo](http://geneseo.edu){:target="blank"} where I received a degree in Mathematics in 2014. I am currently working as a software developer at [Silent Spring Institute](http://silentspring.org){:target="blank"} in the greater Boston area. 

The animation on the background of this site shows the generation of a graph by the [Barabási–Albert model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model) and represents my interest in the computer modelling of biological and sociological processes.
