<p>A non-exhaustive catalog of books that I have read since around 2014, in roughly chronological order of when I read them.</p>

<div class='books'>
  {% for book in site.data.books %}
    <a href='{{ book.link }}'><img src="{{ book.image }}" alt="{{ book.title }} - {{ book.author }}" title="{{ book.title }} - {{book.author }}"/></a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
