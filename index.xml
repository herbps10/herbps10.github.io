      <title>New Publication: Probabilistic Predictions of Emergency Department Arrivals</title>

      <description>Our paper Probabilistic prediction of arrivals and hospitalizations in emergency departments in Île-de-France was published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics. We used a combination of ensemble learning and Adaptive Conformal Inference to predict emergency department arrivals and hospitalizations in and around Paris.
This paper builds on some previous theoretical work establishing that Super Learner can be applied for estimating quantiles in online settings (preprint available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19343).
We also used our R package AdaptiveConformal for Adaptive Conformal Inference, described in our paper in COMPUTO.</description>

      <title>New Preprints: Family Planning Estimation Model and Shrinkage Data Models</title>

      <description>Two new preprints out today related to our work on Bayesian hierarchical models for demographic and health indicators.
The first preprint, joint with Leontine Alkema and Evan Ray, introduces a data model that incorporates Bayesian shrinkage priors as a way to flexibly handle data sources with reporting issues. We have also used shrinkage priors for modeling indicators with large shocks (for example, life expectancy during wars); see our preprint.
The second preprint, led by Leontine, gives an overview of the current iteration of the Family Planning Estimation Model (FPET), which incorporates extensions that I worked on for my dissertation.</description>

      <description>Jeffrey Näf and I have a new preprint available on ArXiv, Causal-DRF: Conditional Kernel Treatment Effect Estimation using Distributional Random Forest. We took some of Jeff&amp;rsquo;s previous work on building distributional random forest&amp;rsquo;s and adapted it to the case of estimating kernel treatment effects. Jeff contributed the heavy-duty theory and I worked on the coding and simulation studies &amp;ndash; a good partnership!</description>

      <description>I recently had an article published in COMPUTO, a journal of the French Royal Statistical Society, titled AdaptiveConformal: An R Package for Adaptive Conformal Inference. The article was cowritten with my collaborators Antoine Chambaz and Julie Josse.
COMPUTO has an interesting publication process that focuses on reproducibility. We wrote the manuscript as an R Quarto document, and we were required to submit a link to the Github repo so reviewers could verify reproducibility.</description>

      <description>Chiesa di San Simeon Piccolo, Venice, Italy.
 I had a wonderful time attending ISBA 2024 in last week, held at the Ca&#39; Foscari University of Venice. I had the opportunity to present at the invited session &amp;ldquo;Novel and Flexible Bayesian Approaches for Causal Inference in Complex Settings&amp;rdquo;, which was organized by Mike Daniels and Maria Josefsson and chaired by Arman Oganisian. The slides and speaker notes for my talk can be found here: Targeted Bayesian Learning for Causal Inference: The Best of Both Worlds?</description>

 Setting up and running simulation studies are a ubiquitous task in applied statistics. In this post, I’ll write up a small simulation study to show how I usually approach setting them up in R. This post will assume a certain level of familiarity with causal inference.
The simulation study will compare a naive estimator of an Average Treatment Effect vs.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, The New York Times published an article about several Major League Baseball players who use the sitcom Friends to improve their English. Friends seems to be a very popular tool for learning English: there’s even an ESL program developed around it, and you can easily find advice on how to use Friends as a language learning tool.
In my own language learning I’ve relied heavily on frequency dictionaries, which order words by their popularity.</description>

      <description>Gun dealers in the U.S. are required to conduct instant background checks before selling weapons to individuals. The FBI provides data for the number of these background checks performed by month/year, which serves as a proxy for the total number of gun sales in the U.S.
I brought the data into R for a quick and dirty analysis, with the intent of finding spikes in background checks around major events.</description>

      <description>Note: this post has been updated with more recent data.
I often use random walk/autoregressive models in my research as a component in time-series analysis, and I wanted to get some more experience fitting them to data. FiveThirtyEight publishes several polling datasets, including polling for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. I used Stan to fit a Bayesian random walk model to the polling data, which I describe below. The Stan and R code used in this post is available as a Github gist.</description>

      <guid>/2019/08/09/autoregressive-processes-are-gaussian-processes/</guid>
      <description>Autoregressive (AR) processes are a popular choice for modeling time-varying processes. AR processes are typically written down as a set of conditional distributions, but if we do some algebra we can show how they can also be written as a Gaussian process. One reason having a Guassian process representation is useful is because it makes it more clear how an AR process can be incorporated into larger models, like a spatio-temporal model.</description>
