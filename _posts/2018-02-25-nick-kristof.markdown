Nick Kristof, columnist for the New York Times, recently [wrote about Detox Me Action Kit](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/23/opinion/columnists/poisons-in-our-bodies.html), a study I manage and helped launch at Silent Spring Institute.

The column includes a nice graphic summarizing his results:
