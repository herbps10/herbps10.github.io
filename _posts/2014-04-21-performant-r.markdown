title: Performant R
description: Presentation on writing performant R programs
---

I was fortunate enough to be able to present at UP-Stat 2014 on some of the things I've learned about writing performant R code while I was working on speeding up an R package for fitting mixed effects nested models. The talk seemed to be a big hit - I was awarded "Best Student Presentation"!
