title: Smartphone interface for reporting research results to study participants
description: We developed a novel interface for reporting results to participants of exposure studies.
---

One of the themes that I worked on at [Silent Spring Institute](https://silentspring.org) was on how to report complex personal data to our study participants. In the [PROTECT](https://web.northeastern.edu/protect/) study, mothers in Puerto Rico were tested for a host of environmental chemicals. Our job was to design a tool to report-back individual results to the participants.

While I was on the project, I designed and implemented a novel smartphone interface for communicating personal results to study participants. One aspect was designing a visualization that allowed participants to compare their results to other women in the study. Our approach uses a [SinaPlot](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/028191v1.article-info) where the participant's personal results are represented by an avatar that they chose when they enter their report. 

Last May I left Silent Spring Institute to pursue graduate school, and I was happy to see that the tool was launched in October! To learn more, check out [the article](https://web.northeastern.edu/protect/protects-community-engagement-core-and-silent-spring-institute-inaugurate-a-mobile-application-to-provide-protect-participants-their-research-results/) the PROTECT team wrote about the launch of the reports.
