      <description>Chiesa di San Simeon Piccolo, Venice, Italy.
 I had a wonderful time attending ISBA 2024 in last week, held at the Ca&#39; Foscari University of Venice. I had the opportunity to present at the invited session &amp;ldquo;Novel and Flexible Bayesian Approaches for Causal Inference in Complex Settings&amp;rdquo;, which was organized by Mike Daniels and Maria Josefsson and chaired by Arman Oganisian. The slides and speaker notes for my talk can be found here: Targeted Bayesian Learning for Causal Inference: The Best of Both Worlds?</description>
