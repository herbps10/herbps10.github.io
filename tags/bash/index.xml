      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last semester I took an introductory course in raytracing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We practiced an iterative development cycle in which we built up more and more complex ray tracers over the course of the semester. The very first ray tracer was pretty simple: it had to be able to intersect rays with simple geometric objects and display the results, but there didn’t have to be any lighting calculations or anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I figured out the assignment in OCaml, I decided to give it a shot entirely in Bash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well, not ENTIRELY in Bash. I will admit I shelled out to bc for floating point operations. A friend pointed out you could do floating point in Bash by having seperate variables for the integer and decimal components, but that’ll have to wait for version two)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It prints out the raytraced image directly to the console using special unicode characters and coloring through escape codes. Here’s what the result looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/bash-ray-tracer.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bash ray tracer output&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly pretty, but it works! (if only there was a way to change the line spacing in gnome-terminal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is available as a gist: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/herbps10/5d606d52e6d18b8c0f34825f22f9c713/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;raytracer.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
