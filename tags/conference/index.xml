      <description>I visited JSM for the first time this year to present our work on generalizations of the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated to longitudinal settings as part of the invited session &amp;ldquo;Advanced Strategies for Longitudinal Causal Inference and Treatment Switching&amp;rdquo;. A preprint is available on ArXiv: Longitudinal Generalizations of the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated for Multi-valued and Continuous Treatments.</description>

      <description>Chiesa di San Simeon Piccolo, Venice, Italy.
 I had a wonderful time attending ISBA 2024 in last week, held at the Ca&#39; Foscari University of Venice. I had the opportunity to present at the invited session &amp;ldquo;Novel and Flexible Bayesian Approaches for Causal Inference in Complex Settings&amp;rdquo;, which was organized by Mike Daniels and Maria Josefsson and chaired by Arman Oganisian. The slides and speaker notes for my talk can be found here: Targeted Bayesian Learning for Causal Inference: The Best of Both Worlds?</description>
